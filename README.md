## Overview

This is a behavioral analysis of 636 sales calls from the Bhanzu dataset. The goal was straightforward — identify what winning reps consistently did that losing reps did not, quantify those gaps, and model the revenue impact of closing them.

The findings are not about product, pricing, or lead quality. Every measurable gap comes down to conversation behavior.

## What the Data Shows

| Metric | Win Calls | Loss Calls | Gap |
|---|---|---|---|
| Avg. discovery questions per call | 4.2 | 1.6 | +62% |
| Objection fully resolved | 74% | 29% | +45% |
| Clear next-step ask made | 88% | 43% | +45% |
| Value linked to parent's words | 78% | 48% | +30% |
| Parent talk share | 58% | 43% | +15% |
| Pricing mentioned in first 3 mins | 6% | 39% | -33% |

## Core Finding

Winners did not have better scripts. They asked more questions, listened longer before pitching, explored objections instead of accepting them, and always closed with a specific next step.

Losses followed a predictable pattern — price came up too early, discovery was shallow, the first objection ended the effort, and calls closed passively.

The structural gap is measurable and correctable.

## Projected Impact

Fixing three behaviors in loss calls — discovery depth, objection resolution, and closing discipline — projects a conversion lift of **18% to 25%** without changing product, pricing, or lead volume.

| Area | Change Required | Projected Lift |
|---|---|---|
| Discovery depth | 1.6 to 4.0 avg questions | +9 to 12% |
| Objection resolution | 29% to 60% resolution rate | +14 to 18% |
| Structured closing | 43% to 80% next-step ask | +8 to 10% |
| Combined | | +18 to 25% |

## Analysis Structure

The interactive dashboards cover six behavioral dimensions — opening and rapport, discovery depth, value proposition delivery, objection handling, closing control, and talk-to-listen ratio — followed by a conversion impact model and a plain-language client summary.
